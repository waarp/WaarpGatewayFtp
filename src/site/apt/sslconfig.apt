Waarp SSL configuration

*How to configure Waarp SSL

	To generate the stores for Waarp, you need to create 1 JKS keyStore. 
	To generate those files, you can use the "keytool" command from the JDK or using 
	the free tool KeyTool IUI (last known version in 2.4.1).

*Using Keytool IUI:

**For SSL connection for Administration HTTPS:

		Create one jks KeyStore (server.jks) with one Private Key Version 3 using 
		RSA algorithm. Use this KeyStore as KeyStore for the Server.
		To do that, suing KeyTool IUI:

			1) Create an empty KeyStore
			
			2) Create a Private Key Version 3 with RSA algorithm added to this KeyStore

*Password Keys

	For Host passwords, admin passwords, Waarp uses encrypted password using private DES key.
	We provide a GUI to generate the DES key (*.des file) and those passwords in files (*.ggp files).
	
	It can be found in the subproject WaarpPassword Gui project.
